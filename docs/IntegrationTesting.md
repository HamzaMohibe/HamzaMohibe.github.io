# Integration Testing with Java, Selenium, and Katalon Recorder

## Introduction

Integration testing is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle that ensures the different components of a system work seamlessly together. In this project, integration testing is performed using Java, Maven, Selenium, and Katalon Recorder to verify the functionality of the web application.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Selenium**: A powerful framework for web application testing that automates browser actions.
- **Katalon Recorder**: A browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that facilitates automated testing through record and playback features.

## Setup

### 1. Maven Project Configuration

The `pom.xml` file should includes the necessary dependencies for Selenium and any other required libraries.

```
<!-- Example dependencies for Selenium and WebDriver -->
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    <version>${selenium-java-version}</version>
    </dependency>

</dependencies>
```

## 2. Selenium WebDriver Setup

**Download and configure the appropriate WebDriver for your browser. In this case, we are using ChromeDriver for Google Chrome.**

### Steps:

1. **Download ChromeDriver:**

   - Visit the [ChromeDriver downloads page](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).
   - Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version.
   - Extract the downloaded zip file to a location on your machine.

2. **Set System Property in Your Test Code:**

   ```
   System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver.exe");
   ```

3. **Create WebDriver Instance:\***

   ```
   WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
   ```

## 3. Katalon Recorder Installation

### Install the Katalon Recorder extension in your Chrome browser. This will be used for recording and generating test scripts.

**Steps:**

1. **Open Chrome Browser:**

   - Launch your Google Chrome browser.

2. **Go to Chrome Web Store:**

   - Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore).

3. **Search for Katalon Recorder:**

   - In the search bar, type "Katalon Recorder."

4. **Install the Extension:**

   - Find the Katalon Recorder extension in the search results.
   - Click on "Add to Chrome" to install the extension.

5. **Confirm Installation:**

   - Confirm the installation by clicking "Add Extension" in the confirmation dialog.

6. **Access Katalon Recorder:**
   - Once installed, you can access Katalon Recorder by clicking on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
